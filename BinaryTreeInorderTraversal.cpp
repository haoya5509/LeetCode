/**
Binary Tree Inorder Traversal Total Accepted: 58705 Total Submissions: 162446 My Submissions Question Solution
Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
return [1,3,2].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
